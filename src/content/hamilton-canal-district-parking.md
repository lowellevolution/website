## Idea: Variable Garage Pricing
Existing parking supply management should be the first step in any plan to generate new capacity for the Courthouse and the Hamilton Canal District area in general. Currently, the city of Lowell subsidizes parking significantly by keeping rates artificially low. Prices are set with this in mind, and pricing is set to keep rates to the lowest possible rate while maintaining the fiscal health of the parking enterprise fund. All garages are locked to the same level, significantly below market rate.

This is not a good approach, as evidenced by the current sitation. The incentives are all wrong, primarily because we are setting rates according to

The actual objective should be maintaining an 85% occupancy rate, night and day, in the city's garages.

## Idea: Add Street Parking to Dutton Street
